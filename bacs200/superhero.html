He prides himself on his willingness to push himself harder than any of the other DC heroes, and he understands the calculus of reality, but his reticence to maim and kill whenever possible is indirectly responsible for the deaths of many.</td>

                The Green Lantern gains his super powers from his power ring. This ring can do most anything depending on the strength of will of the user and his imagination. The Green Lantern has used this ring to fly, to create a green energy which can be used in a variety of ways, to hypnotize people, to become invisible, to translate languages, to pass through solid objects, to heal, to paralyze enemies, and even to time travel.
            </td>
            <td>
                The main weakness of the ring lies in the mental strength of the wearer. It also has a weakness against yellow objects, though this can be overcome if the wearer is strong enough.</td>
