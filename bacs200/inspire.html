        A hero for me is someone who stands up for what they believe and become voices for people who are scared to speak up for themselves or do not have the power to speak up.

        The heroes that I most admire have stood up for others. They made their voices heard even though they were people who had little to no power. The heros that I admire have gone out of their way to make their voices heard even though they had little to no resources.

        Emiliano Zapata is a hero to me because he was poor and a peasant growing up in Mexico. He fought for his own rights and the rights of other peasants. Once he became a popular figure to the public, he gave food and money to people who were less fortunate than him. He always cared for people that were poor and were peasants. He never thought he was more important than other human being. Treating every human being the same no matter their economic status or color of their skin is somthing I have alway made sure I carried in my character. THese are a couple reasons why i have alwys seen Emiliano Zapata as a hero.
